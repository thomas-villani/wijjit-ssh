# wijjit-ssh

**Flask for SSH apps.** Serve [Wijjit](https://github.com/tomvillani/wijjit) TUI
applications over SSH: Wijjit draws the UI, `asyncssh` handles the transport and
PTY, and every connection gets its own live app instance.

> Status: **early.** The core transport seam it builds on
> (`wijjit.terminal.backend.TerminalBackend`) is in Wijjit proper; this package
> is the reference backend + server glue. The input path is production-shaped
> (async byte decoder, no threads); auth and resource limits are not done yet.
> See "Not yet hardened" below.

```python
from wijjit import Wijjit, render_template_string
from wijjit_ssh import WijjitSSH, SSHSession

def make_app(session: SSHSession) -> Wijjit:
    app = Wijjit(backend=session.backend)          # <- routes I/O to the channel
    @app.view("main", default=True)
    def main():
        return render_template_string(
            "{% frame %}{% text %}Hi {{ who }}!{% endtext %}{% endframe %}",
            who=session.username,
        )
    return app

WijjitSSH(make_app, host_keys=["ssh_host_key"]).run(port=8022)
```

```bash
ssh-keygen -f ssh_host_key -N ''      # make a host key (once)
uv run python examples/hello_ssh.py   # serve on :8022
ssh -p 8022 you@localhost             # connect from anywhere
```

## How it works

Wijjit's event loop talks to "the terminal" through a `TerminalBackend` - a
small seam covering four things: frame output, key/mouse input, terminal size,
and whether the app owns the process terminal. Locally that's
`LocalTerminalBackend` (stdout / stdin / `shutil` / signals on).

`wijjit_ssh.RemoteTerminalBackend` implements the same seam against an SSH
channel:

| Concern | Local backend | Remote (SSH) backend |
|---|---|---|
| Frame output | `sys.stdout` | `chan.write(...)` |
| Input | real stdin via prompt_toolkit | channel bytes fed into a prompt_toolkit **pipe input** (same key/mouse parser) |
| Size | `shutil.get_terminal_size()` | negotiated PTY size, refreshed on resize, published per-task |
| Terminal ownership | `owns_terminal=True` (signals/atexit/suspend/raw mode) | `owns_terminal=False` (none of that) |

Because Wijjit's render context and the terminal-size override are
**contextvar-based**, N concurrent sessions of different sizes coexist in one
process without stepping on each other - each runs as its own asyncio task.

## Done

- **Async byte-decoded input.** Raw channel bytes are decoded into Wijjit
  key/mouse events on the event loop - no thread and no prompt_toolkit pipe per
  session. Handles split escape sequences, split UTF-8 runes, SGR + legacy
  mouse, bracketed paste, and the lone-ESC ambiguity. (`wijjit_ssh.input`)
- **Binary channel** (`encoding=None`): the decoder sees exactly what the client
  sent.
- **Per-session isolation.** N concurrent sessions, each with its own app, state,
  and terminal size, in one process and one event loop.

## Not yet hardened

- **Auth is open by default** (any username, no credential). Wire real
  key/password auth before exposing this anywhere untrusted. *(next milestone)*
- **No resource limits**: no max-sessions cap, per-IP cap, or idle timeout.
- Blocking sync handlers stall that session's frames - give CPU-bound apps an
  executor.

See [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) for the full plan and remaining milestones.

## Development

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e . --no-deps
uv pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pyte black ruff mypy
uv run pytest                     # 175 tests
```

Wijjit is not on PyPI yet, so install it editable alongside:
`uv pip install -e ../wijjit`.
